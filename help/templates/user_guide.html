      Overview of eConvenor
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>1.&nbsp; eConvenor is a tool which helps the convenor/secretary of a group save time and be organised.</p>
      <p>2.&nbsp; eConvenor uses email to communicate with your group's participants. Participants don't get an eConvenor account because they don't need one. This keeps things simple for everyone.</p>
      <p>3.&nbsp; eConvenor produces clear, well-structured meeting agendas and minutes.</p>
      <p>4.&nbsp; eConvenor tracks tasks assigned to your group's participants and automatically sends them email reminders when their tasks are becoming due.</p>
      <p>5.&nbsp; eConvenor keeps an easy-to-navigate list of all the decisions your groups makes.</p>
